**Frontend**

Since the pages are coded in html and css, you can open them in a web browser to check.

The starting page is screen_1.html.

The guide_me folder has the html pages for the basic, elaborate and walkthrough guide me pages for all the tasks.
The javascript folder has the supporting javascript code for the theme quiz and code highlights in all the walkthrough pages.
The resources folder has the necessary images, videos and css files.

Here, demonstration videos for each task are displayed the entire time in screen_1.html, screen_2_1.html, etc.
But in the actual app, coppeliasim visual stream server is displayed so you can view the evaluation happen in the coppeliasim scene through the app.
Even the theme quiz is static but in the app, the questions are jumbled.
Loading screen is also not present in this folder.
