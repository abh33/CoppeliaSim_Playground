            <h2>FRUIT PLUCKING ROBOT THEME DESCRIPTION<br><br>
                - Overall outcome:<br>
                To design a robot which can autonomously move in an known arena and pluck and deposit ripe fruits
                from a tree.<br><br>
                - Major Challenges:<br>
                1. Preparing the arena.<br>
                2. Designing and developing robotic arm required for plucking.<br>
                3. Line following and Odometry.<br>
                4. Identifying ripe and unripe fruits using proper sensor integration.<br>
                5. Coding the algorithm for navigation and plucking of fruits.<br><br>
                - Technical Stack:<br>
                1. Firebird-V robot.<br>
                2. ATMEL STUDIO 6 - a free software for programming AVR microcontroller.<br>
                3. 3D Cad designing of the Robotic arm.<br><br>
                - Major Rules: -<br>
                1. The robot will first start from the START position by pressing only a single switch.<br>
                2. Once the robot is switched on, human intervention is NOT allowed i.e. the robot is fully
                autonomous.<br>
                3. The robot must be self contained, and not externally operated by wire or by remote radio control
                during the competition.<br>
                4. The robot have to follow the printed lines on the arena for moving.<br>
                5. The robot have to correctly distinguish between ripe and unripe fruits and plucks and collects the
                ripe fruits without any harm to the unripe fruits.<br>
                6. While moving and plucking fruits the robot should not damage the arena.<br>
                7. After plucking all the ripe fruits, the robot have to deposit them in the deposition Zones.<br>
                8. After depositing the fruits the robot must sounds a continuous buzzer.<br>
                9. The maximum time given for completing the task is 10 minutes.<br>
                10. A run ends and the timer is stopped when either the robot stops and sounds the continuous
                buzzer or If the maximum time limit for completing the task is reached or If the team needs
                repositioning but has used both repositioning options of that run.</h2>
